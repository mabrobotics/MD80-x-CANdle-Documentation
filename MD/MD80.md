## General parameters

MD80 is a brushless motor controller. It can work with a variety of motors and reducers that can be
precisely matched to the users’ specifications. All MD80 variants are using an advanced motor
control algorithm (FOC), a high-resolution encoder, a high-speed FDCAN communication bus, and a
common communication interface. The controller features position PID, velocity PID, impedance,
profile position and profile velocity operation modes. MD80 can be easily daisy-chained, for easy
connection of many drives in a single control network.

```{warning}
MD80 is not suited for working on 12S lithium batteries, as their fully charged voltage exceeds maximum input voltage. MAB recommends to use MD80 with up to 10S batteries, for safe and reliable operation. For 12S and bigger batteries, please refer to MD80HV, that can operate up to 60V.

## Connectors pinout

The connectors used in the system on the CAN FD side are MOLEX Micro-Fit series 3.0. Both connectors
are connected in parallel for easy daisy-chaining. The connector pinout with respected color coding
is presented below:

```{warning}
<font color='red'> Always make sure CAN bus lines are not shorted to the positive power rail. Applying supply voltage to these pins will cause permanent damage to the controller! </font> 
```

### Thermistor connection

All MD80 versions have the capability to measure the MOSFET and motor temperature. This is to ensure
the safe operation of the driver and motor. The motor shutdown temperature is configurable up to
140°C max with a hysteresis of 20°C. The driver shutdown temperature is fixed at 100°C with a
hysteresis of 20°C.

In the case of the MD80 HW V2.0 the MOSFET thermistor is built-in directly under the power stage and
only the motor thermistor connector is available:

```{note}
On older (<HW2.2) designs NTCMHP100K is recommended.
```

````

```{note}
For the HW2.2+ and HW3.0+ version of the board we recommend using [NTCMHP10K thermistors](https://www.mabrobotics.pl/product-page/thermistor). Using other thermistors may result in imprecise temperature readout.
```

### Aux connectors

MD80 HW2.1+ and HW3.0+ feature two accessory connectors.

**Aux 1 connector** is dedicated to connect MABs
[ME_am](https://www.mabrobotics.pl/product-page/me-am) and other SPI based encoders. For external
encoder connection via the SPI *530480650 Molex PicoBlade* connectors is provided.

```{warning}
<font color='red'>The auxiliary connector pins are 3.3V tolerant. Applying 5V to these pins will cause permanent damage to the controller! </font> 
```

```

**Aux 2 connector** has two user-configurable GPIOs, and RS422 interface for connecting to RLS Axim2
encoder. AUX GPIO A pin can be used as an automatic brake control output signal. This signal when
amplified, can be used to control
[MAB SLIM](https://www.mabrobotics.pl/product-page/mab-slim-electromagnetic-brake) electromagnetic
brakes. Enabling of this mode is done via `userGpioConfiguration` register. When enabled driver will
automatically disengage the brake when enabled. For external encoder connection via the RS422 and
the GPIO pins utilization *530480810 Molex PicoBlade* connectors could be used.

We are able to integrate custom functions such as GPIOs for external sensors and indicators. For
