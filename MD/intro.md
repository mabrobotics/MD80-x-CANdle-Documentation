# MD

MD is series of FOC-based, brushless (BLDC) motor controllers, targeted for application in mobile
robots and robotic platforms.

MD drivers offer:

- high efficiency,
- ultra-high power density,
- advanced motion control strategies,
- integrated encoder (14-bit),
- FDCAN and CANOpen communication,
- support for external encoders (up to 17 bit),
- support for EM brakes,
- small size,
- low weight.

Current variants of MD motor controllers:

## [MD80](/MD/MD80)

Suitable for most BLDC motors in 100-500W power range. ![MD80](./images/md80_hmd.jpg)

## [MD20](/MD/MD20)

Best for gimbal BLDC motor, and smaller motors up to 120W. ![MD20](./images/md20_coin.jpg)

## [MD80 60V](/MD/MD80HV)

For high voltage applications.\

## Safety information

Even though the MD series motor controller are small, they can push a substantial amount of current
through the motor windings. This means there are many hazards related to the high torques that the
actuator is able to produce as well as elevated temperatures that may occur close to the MDs or the
motor. Always make sure the actuator is mounted firmly and does not pose a threat to its
surroundings. Make sure the power supply current limits are set to low values (~1A) as an additional
safety measure when you are unsure about the tested behavior of the system.

## Principle of operation

MD drivers are specialized FOC-based servo controllers. The controller works by using a position
sensor (encoder) and measure motor currents, to control PWM signals sent to motor phases, and thus,
produce precise currents in motor windings, in effect producing torque.

Current control is performed in a struct 40kHz control-loop, allowing for high-bandwidth control of
dynamics system - like legged robots or drones; or to control low latency systems like collaborative
manipulators.

MD drivers are equipped with sensors that allow for measuring the motor position, velocity, and
torque. Whether the motor has an integrated gearbox or not, **the position, velocity, and torque**
are in the output shaft reference frame. This means that changing the position from 0.0 to 2$\\pi$
radians, will result in approximately one rotation of the motor for direct-drive (gearless) servos
and approximately one rotation of the gearbox output shaft for geared motors.

### Position

To measure the position of the rotor the MD driver uses an internal magnetic encoder. The resolution
of the encoder is 14 bits (16384 counts per rotation). The drive aggregates all the measurements to
provide **multi-rotation positional feedback**. The reference position (0.0 rad) is set by the user
and stored in the non-volatile memory. Position is measured in 40kHz loop.

```{note}
When using geared actuators with gear ratios above 1:1 it is not possible to determine the position
after startup unambiguously, since the motor completes multiple rotations per single rotation of
the output shaft. For example, for a 2:1 gearbox, there are two sections within a single output
shaft rotation where the motor shaft is in the same position. Unless the motor is placed in the
wrong “section” during startup the absolute encoder functionality will work. To combat this issue,
an auxiliary (output) encoder can be used. See [Encoders](encoders) section.
```

### Velocity

The velocity is estimated by measuring position change in time, at a frequency of 40kHz. The
measurements are then filtered using a low-pass filter with a cut-off frequency of 5 kHz since the
position differentiation method introduces noise.

### Torque

Actuator torque is estimated by measuring motor phase currents. This method can be used on low-gear
ratio actuators (preferably below 9:1), that are easily back-drivable, to get an estimate of the
torque applied by the motor. In applications with higher gear ratios, the torque readout might be
less accurate due to excessive friction in the gearbox.
