## Introduction
The **MAB SLIM** is a series of ultra thin brake systems designed for mobile robotics applications. Brakes are holding when power is off, relieving motors from power consumption on holding static loads. The series is compatible with **MD** Series drivers controllers and has to be used as a **MD add-on** in a form of the MAB brake controller (**MBC**). Brakes can operate in 24-60VDC power supply range and their modularity allows for choosing a holding torque from a wide range of 0.06-38 Nm.

For more information on picking particular brake for your application see our product page [here](https://www.mabrobotics.pl/product-page/mab-slim-electromagnetic-brake). 

## MBC

MD Brake Controller is a device dedicated to control MAB SLIM Electromagnetic Brakes via PWM controlled signal provided by MD board.

### Functional Description

```

The product has an open-drain output in the form of two solderable pads (J3) for control of the brake state. Output's state is directly controlled via input PWM signal provided on the pin 1 of the control logic connector (J2) with return path provided on pin 2.

Output state is high-impedance when the PWM pin is set low. Low-impedance when the PWM pin is set high.

Logical controls are galvanically isolated from the power circuitry, unless the jumper JP1 is soldered.

With each shipping of MBC and SLIM brake we include necessary wiring:

- **Power cable (10 cm)** - <span style='color: red'>**Red**</span> and **Black** wire pair ending with a black J1 connector are intended power supply for the brake. It can be provided via external tri-connectors or directly from power supply. 
- **PWM signal cable (10 cm)** - <span style='color: green'>**Green**</span> and <span style='color: brown'>**Brown**</span> wire pair ending with a white J2 connector connect to the 8-pin header on the MD boards.

Brakes come with wires already integrated.

```{note}
When there is no space for external connection of power there is a possibility to solder the power wires directly onto the MD board, however this is not recommended. 
```

```{important}
The power supply voltage must be the same as MD's in order for the MBC to operate correctly with the MD.
```



```{note}
MD utilizes GPIO B of its connector to generate PWM signal so it is always utilized by the board 
when external brake is enabled.
However, if there is a necessity to utilize the 8-pin connector for other purposes, 
such as a RLS encoder, the GND signal from this connector can be disconnected.
This requires the jumper at the bottom of the MBC to be soldered in closed position. It eliminates galvanic isolation between the MCU signal and coil connector
which in over-current scenarios can possibly destroy the driver.
```

In order for the MD to utilize SLIM system the driver must be properly configured. See [GPIO](GPIO) and [User Gpio Configuration register](registers) section for more details.
