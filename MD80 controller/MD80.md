# MD80

## General parameters

MD80 is a brushless motor controller. It can work with a variety of motors and reducers that can be precisely matched to the users’ specifications. All MD80 variants are using an advanced motor control algorithm (FOC), a high-resolution encoder, a high-speed FDCAN communication bus, and a common communication interface. The controller feratures position PID, velocity PID, impedance, raw torque, profile position and profile velocity operation modes. MD80 can be easily daisy-chained, for easy connection of many drives in a single control network.

```{hint}
You can easily check your MD80 version using the [`mdtool setup info`](mdtool_setup_info) command.

## Connectors pinout

The connectors used in the system on the CAN FD side are MOLEX Micro-Fit series 3.0. Both connectors are connected in parallel for easy daisy-chaining. The connector pinout is presented below:

:class: no-scaled-link
```

```

The colors of the corresponding wires in the Molex socket, as supplied by MAB (looking from the side of the wires):

:class: bg-primary mb-1
:align: center
:class: no-scaled-link
```

```{warning}
<font color='red'> Always make sure CAN bus lines are not shorted to the positive power rail. Applying supply voltage to these pins will cause permanent damage to the controller! </font> 
```

All MD80 versions have the capability to measure the MOSFET and motor temperature. This is to ensure the safe operation of the driver and motor. The motor shutdown temperature is configurable up to 140$^\circ$C max with a hysteresis of 20$^\circ$C. The driver shutdown temperature is fixed at 100$^\circ$C with a hysteresis of 20$^\circ$C. 

The connectors in the case of the HW1.1 and HV1.3 versions are located as follows:

```{figure} ../images/HW11_thermistor.png
:alt: candle
:scale: 30%
:class: bg-primary mb-1
:align: center
:class: no-scaled-link
```

In the case of the MD80 HW V2.0 the MOSFET thermistor is built-in directly under the power stage and only the motor thermistor connector is available:

```{figure} ../images/HW20_thermistor.png
:alt: candle
:scale: 50%
:class: bg-primary mb-1
:align: center
:class: no-scaled-link
```

```{note}
We recommend using NTCMHP100K thermistors, as internally the MD80s are using a lookup table compatible with these sensors. Using other thermistors may result in imprecise temperature readout.
```

Since version HW V2.0 the PCB is equipped with an auxiliary connector (picoblade series connector 53048-0650 compatible with 797580006 and 510210600) for communication with [output encoders](output_encoder). The connector pinout is available below:

```{figure} ../images/aux_pinout.png
:alt: candle
:class: bg-primary mb-1
:align: center
:class: no-scaled-link
```

External connector pin functions (RS422 / SPI) are selectable using resistors on the bottom PCB side.

```{warning}
<font color='red'>The auxiliary connector pins are 3.3V tolerant. Applying 5V to these pins will cause permanent damage to the controller! </font> 
```

The HW2.1 features a separate RS422 connector. The AUX1 pinout remains the same while the AUX2 connector's piniut is shown below:
